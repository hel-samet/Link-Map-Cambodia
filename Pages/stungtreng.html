                    Svay Rieng University is paving the way for a higher caliber of education throughout Cambodia and a
                    greater number of research projects, conducted by Cambodian scholars on topics relevant to the
                    country. The accessible and pertinent Master’s Degree programmes at Svay Rieng University aim to
                    improve students’ willingness and capability of pursuing higher levels of education. Candidates in
                    any of the three Masters programmes will receive full support to research new insights about the
                    country and publish their work internationally.

                    Svay Rieng University is also in the process of adding two new Master’s Degree programmes – Food
                    Processing and Robotics – as a part of its incoming Faculty of Engineering. Applications should be
                    open for the 2021-2022 academic year. For more information,</p>
